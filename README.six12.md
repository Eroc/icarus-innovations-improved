- Accepts magazines loaded with slugs or regular shells. There is a 1 in 4 chance that when a Six12 spawns it will be loaded with slugs.
- Loadout Codes are `612`, `6sh`, and `6sl` for weapon, shell mag, and slug mag, respectively.
- Loadout Configuration Code `slugs` to have the weapon loaded with slugs on map start.

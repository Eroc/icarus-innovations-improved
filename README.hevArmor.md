### Notes
---
- HEV Armor is designed to be an effective combat suit built to withstand the elemental hazards of both the Tyrant's forces and the realm from which they came. It's slightly more protective and reliable than Garrison Armor but with added elemental protection at the cost of increased weight and movement speed.
- HEV Armor can be found natrually in the world. It has approximately an 18.75% chance to replace Garrison or Battle Armor. They can also be sold by the [Merchant](https://gitlab.com/accensi/hd-addons/merchant).
- Loadout code is `hve` to start with the armor equipped.
- Loadout code is `hva` to start with a spare in your inventory.

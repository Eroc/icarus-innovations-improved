# Icarus Innovations, Improved

_Requires [BulletLib - Recasted](https://github.com/HDest-Community/HDBulletLib-Recasted) and [AceCoreLib](https://github.com/HDest-Community/AceCoreLib), by the HDest Community._

This mod aims to maintain and improve Icarus's Innovations, by updating them to the latest HDest main, as well as tweaking/fixing any bugs that come along the way.  All weapons can be found naturally, as well as dropping from [Weapon Crates](https://github.com/HDest-Community/weapon-crate) and being sold by the [Merchant](https://github.com/HDest-Community/merchant).
